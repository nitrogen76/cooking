# Brown Butter (Beurre Noisette)

## Ingredients
- Unsalted butter (start with 4–8 Tbsp, scale as needed)

## Steps
1. **Melt**
   - Place butter in a light-colored skillet or saucepan (easier to see color changes).
   - Heat over **medium**.

2. **Foam & sizzle**
   - Butter will melt, then foam, and you’ll hear a gentle crackling as water evaporates.
   - Swirl the pan occasionally.

3. **Brown**
   - After 4–6 minutes, milk solids sink to the bottom and turn golden brown.
   - Watch closely—the color shifts fast from gold → amber → dark brown.
   - You’ll smell a nutty, caramel-like aroma when it’s ready.

4. **Remove from heat**
   - Pull pan off heat immediately once golden brown.
   - Pour into a heatproof bowl to stop cooking.

## Notes
- **Storage**: Keeps 1 week in fridge, longer if frozen.
- **Uses**: Drizzle over veggies, pasta, fish, steak, or even desserts like cookies and pancakes.
- **Caution**: If it goes black, it’s burnt butter—bitter instead of nutty.
