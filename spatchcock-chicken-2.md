## 🔪 Instructions

### 1. Prep the Chicken
1. Preheat oven to **450 °F (232 °C)**.  
2. Place the chicken **breast-side down** on a cutting board.  
3. Use kitchen shears to cut along both sides of the backbone; remove it.  
4. Flip the chicken **breast-side up** and press down firmly to flatten (you may hear a crack).  
5. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Optionally, refrigerate uncovered for 30 minutes to dry the skin.

### 2. Season
1. In a small bowl, mix garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper.  
2. In another bowl, whisk together olive oil, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice.  
3. Rub the dry spices all over the chicken, then coat with the mustard mixture—get under the skin if you’re feeling bold.
