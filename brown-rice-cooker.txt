Buttery Brown Rice (Zojirushi Cheat Card)

What you need (for 2 cups uncooked brown rice):
•	2 cups brown rice (rinsed well)
•	Water (fill just above the “Brown Rice” line in the cooker, ~4½ cups)
•	3–4 Tbsp butter (add at the end)
•	1 tsp salt (or to taste)
•	Optional: replace 1–2 cups of water with chicken broth for richer flavor

Steps:
1.	Rinse & soak
•	Rinse rice until water runs mostly clear.
•	Add to cooker, cover with water, and soak 30–60 minutes (optional but softens texture).
2.	Set & forget
•	Fill water just above the Brown Rice line.
•	Select the Brown Rice setting. Press Start.
•	Let the Zojirushi work its magic (~80–90 minutes).
3.	Butter finish
•	When cooking cycle ends and it switches to “Keep Warm,” immediately open lid.
•	Stir in butter + salt while rice is steaming hot.
•	Re-close lid and let it rest 10 minutes.
4.	Serve & enjoy
•	Fluff with spatula. Soft, buttery brown rice that eats like white.

Notes:
•	Softer rice? Add a little more water next time.
•	Richer flavor? More butter, or broth swap.
•	Leftovers reheat beautifully in the microwave with a splash of water.
