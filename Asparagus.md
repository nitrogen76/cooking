# Roasted Asparagus (Butter-Only Edition)

## Ingredients
- 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed
- 2–3 Tbsp butter
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp garlic salt
- Optional: squeeze of lemon juice or sprinkle of Parmesan

## Steps
1. **Preheat oven**
   - Set to **420°F (215°C)**.

2. **Season**
   - Place trimmed asparagus on a baking sheet.
   - Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.
   - Do *not* add butter yet (prevents burning).

3. **Roast**
   - Cook for **10–15 minutes**, depending on preferred texture:
     - 10 min = firmer, snappy.
     - 15 min = softer, more tender.

4. **Finish with butter**
   - Remove asparagus from oven.
   - Immediately toss with butter so it melts over hot spears.
   - Optional: squeeze lemon juice or add Parmesan.

5. **Serve**
   - Enjoy while warm as a side for seafood, steak, or chicken.

## Notes
- For extra browning, switch oven to **broil** for the last 1–2 minutes, then add butter after.
- Clarified butter (ghee) works too and resists burning at high heat.
