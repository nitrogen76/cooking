# Broiled Lobster Tails (Idiotproof Edition)

## Ingredients
- Lobster tails (fresh or thawed if frozen)
- 2 Tbsp melted butter per tail
- 1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of paprika (for color & smoky note)
- Lemon wedges, for serving

## Steps
1. **Preheat broiler**
   - Set oven to **broil (high)**.
   - Place rack about 6 inches from the heat source.

2. **Prep lobster tails**
   - Use kitchen scissors to cut the top shell lengthwise.
   - Gently pull shell apart and lift meat to rest on top (butterflying).

3. **Season**
   - Mix melted butter, garlic, salt, and paprika.
   - Brush generously over lobster meat.

4. **Broil**
   - Place tails on foil-lined baking sheet.
   - Cook for about **1 minute per ounce** (shell-on weight).
   - Example: 6 oz tail = ~6 minutes.
   - Keep watch—the meat should turn opaque and white, shells bright red.

5. **Check doneness**
   - Use a thermometer in the thickest part of meat (not shell).
   - Target **140–145°F (60–63°C)** internal temperature.
   - Meat should be firm, white, and slightly curled.

6. **Finish & serve**
   - Drizzle with extra melted butter.
   - Add a squeeze of lemon.
   - Eat shamelessly (fork optional, fingers encouraged).

## Notes
- If fridge-cold, cooking may take slightly longer—use thermometer as final check.
- Double-butter finish = restaurant vibes.
- Works with shrimp or scallops using the same seasoning.
