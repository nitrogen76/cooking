# Hot Bottom Feeder Crab Boil

## Ingredients
- Live blue crabs (fresh from the bay, “hot bottom feeders”)
- Water (enough to cover the crabs in your pot)
- Beer (cheap lager works best)
- Old Bay seasoning (don’t be shy)
- Rock salt
- Vinegar
- Butter (lots of it, melted)
- Hot sauce (your choice)
- Lemons, cut into wedges

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the pot**  
   - Fill with a mix of **water, beer, vinegar, rock salt, and Old Bay**.  
   - Bring it to a roaring boil.

2. **Add the crabs**  
   - Drop in the **live crabs** (claws clacking — that’s the point).  
   - Sprinkle more Old Bay directly onto the crabs.  
   - Cover the pot and steam until the shells turn bright red.

3. **Make the butter dip**  
   - Melt **butter** in a separate saucepan.  
   - Add a shake of Old Bay and a dash of **hot sauce**.  
   - Keep warm for dipping.

4. **Serve it up**  
   - Pile the steamed crabs on newspaper or brown paper bags.  
   - Squeeze **lemon wedges** over the top.  
   - Provide mallets, picks, and cold beer on the side.  

5. **Eat like a bottom feeder**  
   - Crack the claws, pick the meat, dip in spicy butter.  
   - Don’t be shy about the mess — that’s part of the ritual.
