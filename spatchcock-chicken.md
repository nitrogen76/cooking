# Spatchcocked Lemongrass Chicken

**Prep Time:** up to 1 day  
**Cook Time:** ~40 minutes  
**Servings:** 1 spatchcocked chicken (about 4-5 lbs)  

## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken (about 4-5 lbs)  
- ½ cup shredded lemongrass (use fresh stalks; a microplane grater works well)  
- 2 tablespoons minced shallot  
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic  
- 5 teaspoons fish sauce  
- 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce  
- 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes  
- 1½ teaspoons salt  
- 2 tablespoons sugar  
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (+ extra to brush grill pan)  
- Cilantro for garnishing (optional)  

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded lemongrass, minced shallot, minced garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, salt, sugar, and vegetable oil. Whisk together until well mixed.  
2. Prepare the chicken: With the breast side down, locate and remove the backbone using sharp kitchen shears by cutting down each side of the spine. Then flip the chicken breast-side up and press down on the sternum until the chicken flattens out (this is the “spatchcock” or butter-flied technique).  
3. Place the flattened chicken into a non-reactive dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, rub the marinade in (including under the skin where possible for extra flavor) and ensure the chicken is well coated.  
4. Cover and marinate the chicken for **at least 1 hour** and up to **24 hours** in the refrigerator.  
5. When ready to cook, preheat your oven to 350 °F (≈ 175 °C). Also pre-heat a grill pan to high heat on the stovetop.  
6. Brush the grill pan with a little oil. Place the chicken breast-side down on the hot grill pan. Sear for about **4-5 minutes**, or until distinct grill marks/blackened sear marks appear. Then flip the chicken.  
7. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh. Transfer the entire pan into the preheated oven and roast **uncovered** for about **35-40 minutes**, or until the thermometer reads **165 °F (≈ 74 °C)** in the thigh.  
8. Remove from the oven, let rest briefly, then serve garnished with cilantro (if using).  

## Notes & Tips

- The fresh lemongrass is key to the flavor profile here; don’t substitute with dried or weak stalks if you can avoid it.  
- Spatchcocking the chicken reduces cooking time and helps it cook more evenly.  
- Using a meat thermometer is highly recommended: thigh meat takes longest to cook, and once it hits the safe temperature the rest is likely done.  
- If you’d rather finish on a grill instead of the oven, you can do so — you’ll just need to monitor heat and timing accordingly.  
- Allowing the chicken to rest a few minutes after roasting helps juices redistribute so the bird stays juicy.
