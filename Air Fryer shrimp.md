# Air Fryer Shrimp (Frozen or Thawed)

## Ingredients
- 1 lb shrimp (peeled & deveined, tail-on optional; thaw if frozen)
- 1–2 Tbsp olive oil (or melted butter for extra richness)
- 1 tsp garlic powder (or 2 cloves minced garlic if fresh)
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (optional but tasty)
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Lemon wedges, for serving

## Steps
1. **Prep shrimp**
   - Thaw if frozen (cold water method ~15 min).
   - Pat dry with paper towels.
   - Toss in bowl with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.

2. **Preheat air fryer**
   - 400°F (200°C) for 3 minutes.

3. **Cook shrimp**
   - Arrange in single layer in basket/tray (don’t overcrowd).
   - Air fry **6–8 minutes**, shaking halfway through.
   - Shrimp are done when **pink, opaque, and slightly curled**.

4. **Serve**
   - Optional drizzle of melted butter or squeeze of lemon.
   - Enjoy immediately—shrimp go rubbery if they sit too long.

## Notes
- Internal temp for shrimp: **120°F (49°C)**.
- For extra flavor: toss with a little Parmesan + parsley after cooking.
- Works in an oven’s air fry mode too—just expect 1–2 minutes longer cook time.
